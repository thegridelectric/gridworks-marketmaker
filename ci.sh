# else, so a local pass is a CI pass. Run it before committing.
#
# The broker test needs the gwbase dev broker (gw-dev-rabbit, started from
# gridworks-base with ./arm.sh or ./x86.sh). When one answers on
# localhost:5672 the script points GWMM_TEST_RABBIT_URL at its d1__1 vhost;
# without one the test self-skips.
#
# Usage: ./ci.sh
